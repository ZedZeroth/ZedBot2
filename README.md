# ZedBot [README incomplete]

*Note: The four key entities not represented by Eloquent models are written uppercase and bold. These are: **NETWORK**, **EXCHANGE**, **MARKET**, and **API**. The twelve Eloquent models are written capitalized and bold: e.g. **Customer**, **Trade**, etc.*

## Purpose

ZedBot is an semi-automated currency exchange application. It interacts with currency **MARKET**s, **EXCHANGE** platforms, and payment **NETWORK**s via their **API**s in order to:

1. Calculate exchange **Rate**s.
2. Maintain **Offer**s at competitive **Rate**s.
3. Detect new **Trade**s and communicate with a **Customer**'s exchange **Profile** via **Message**s, to either:
    1. Assist new **Customer**s with onboarding/verification, or
    2. Provide "buyer" **Customer**s with an **Invoice**.
4. It then either:
    1. Detects **Payment**s from a "buyer" **Customer**'s verified **Account** and completes the relevant **Trade**, or
    1. Makes a **Payment** to a "seller" **Customer**'s verified **Account**.
5. *[Is a Receipt model requied?]*
6. **Customer** processing also involves **IdentityDocument** and **RiskAssessment** models.

*Note: The **Currency** model is used throughout the application.*

## Development & design

I aim to implment Test Driven Development (TDD) and Domain Driven Design (DDD) while applying SOLID principles. "Single Responsibility" classes and "Interface Segregation" drive the use of many small and specific classes/interfaces as opposed to "fat" "God-like" ones. "Dependency Inversion" and "Dependency Injection" are both applied to create loose couplings so that changes can be applied to one class without requiring change to others.

## Models & their actions

### Account

These represent financial accounts, such as bank accounts and blockchain addresses, on various payment networks. They are originators or beneficiaries of Payments in a single currency, they have a holder (who may be a Customer), and they may be assigned a balance in their currency.

Their actions include:

- **Add**: This creates a new account on the payment network.
- **Fetch**: This fetches information for a specific account and updates the Eloquent model accordingly.
- **Synchronize**: This fetches a batch of accounts from an API, updates their Eloquent models accordingly, and creates new models where they don't already exist.
- **Update**: This creates/updates an Eloquent model from a model DTO.
- **View**: This allows details of each account to be viewed via the browser.

### Currency

These represent financial currencies such as GBP and BTC. They include the relevant details useful for text formatting and denomination conversion.

Their actions include:

- **Populate**: This builds all the currency models required by the platform and only needs to be run once upon initialization.
- **Update**: This creates/updates an Eloquent model from a model DTO.
- **View**: This allows details of each currency to be viewed via the browser.

### Customer

These represent people or companies engaged in exchanging currencies. They must be verified according to regulations and are categorized as **natural persons**, **companies**, **financial institutions** (e.g. banks/VASPs), **personal account holders** (for non-business payments), and **self** (my own accounts/profiles). Customers hold Accounts on payment networks and Profiles on exchange platforms.

Their actions include:

- **Add**: Allows a new verified customer to be added via the browser.
- **Import**: This fetches a batch of customers from a CSV file, updates their Eloquent models accordingly, and creates new models where they don't already exist.
- **Update**: This creates/updates an Eloquent model from a model DTO.
- **View**: This allows details of each currency to be viewed via the browser.

### Payment

These represent transactions in a single Currency on various payment networks. They have an originator and a beneficiary Account.

Their actions include:

- **Fetch**: This fetches information for a specific Payment and updates the Eloquent model accordingly.
- **Pay**: This creates a new Payment on the payment network.
- **Synchronize**: This fetches a batch of Payments from an API, updates their Eloquent models accordingly, and creates new models where they don't already exist.
- **Update**: This creates/updates an Eloquent model from a model DTO.
- **View**: This allows details of each Payment to be viewed via the browser.

## "Command to action" chain

Commands can be triggered by the CLI, the browser, or the scheduler. The resulting chain of events is structured as follows:

*input*

## Non-model entities (4)

The four key entities not represented by Eloquent models are:

### NETWORK (Payment networks involve *indirect* API interaction)

All **Payment**s and **Account**s exist on a real-world payment **NETWORK** such as the UK banking "FPS" network or the decentralized "Bitcoin" blockchain network.

### EXCHANGE (Exchange platforms involve *direct* API interaction)

All **Profile**s, **Offer**s, **Trade**s, **Message**s, and **Invoice**s exist on a real-world **EXCHANGE** platform such as "LBC" or "ZZR".

### MARKET (Currency markets involve *direct* API interaction)

All **Rate**s exist on a real-world currency **MARKET** such as "GMN" or "BFX".

*Note: Models not tied directly to a **NETWORK**, **EXCHANGE**, or **MARKET** include:*
1. ***Customer**s and their associated **IdentityDocument**s and **RiskAssessment***s
3. *The **Currency** model.*

### API (Servies that provide APIs)

All interactions with **NETWORK**s, **EXCHANGE**s, and **MARKET**s are made via **API**s and their respective adapter classes. Note that **NETWORK**s do not have their own **API** and hence are interacted with indirectly (e.g. via the **API**s of banks or blockchain explorers). **EXCHANGE**s and **MARKET**s provide their own **API**s and are interacted with directly.

## Model categorization & relationships (12)

Eloquent models can be grouped into the following five categories.

*Note: Relationships to models in other categories are written in bold.*

### Customer-based models (3)

* **Customer** ("hasMany" IdentityDocuments, RiskAssessments, **Profile**s, and **Account**s)
    * **IdentityDocument** ("belongsTo" 1 Customer)
    * **RiskAssessment** ("belongsTo" 1 Customer)

### Exchange-based models (5)

* **Profile**  ("belongsTo" 1 **Customer**) ("hasMany" Offers)
    * **Offer** ("belongsTo" 1 Profile and 2 **Currency**) ("hasMany" Trades)
    * **Trade** ("belongsTo" 1 Offer and 1 "taker" Profile) ("hasMany" Messages) ("hasOne" Invoice)
    * **Message** ("belongsTo" 1 Trade)
    * **Invoice** ("belongsTo" 1 Trade) ("hasMany" **Payment**s)

### Network-based models (2)

* **Account** ("belongsTo" 1 **Customer** and 1 **Currency**) ("hasMany" Payments)
    * **Payment** ("belongsTo" 2 Accounts) ("hasMany" **Invoice**s)

### Market-based models (1)

* **Rate** ("belongsTo" 2 **Currency**)

### The Currency model (1)

* **Currency** ("hasMany" **Rate**s, **Offer**s, and **Account**s)

## Model identifiers

All models have a unique incrementing integer "id" property used in the Eloquent database as their primary key, and as a foreign key for defining their relationships. In addition to this "id" property, each model has other unique identifier properties used for identification either on ZedBot's internal system, on **NETWORK**s/**EXHANGE**s, or in communication with **Customers**. Such identifiers allow a single real-world entity to be mapped to a single model despite originating from different API calls, while ensuring that collisions do not occur (more than one real-world entity being mapped to the same model).

### Customer Identifier

"customer"::customer_id::surname::surname_collision_increment::given_name_1::given_name_2

### IdentityDocument Identifier

"identity_document"::customer_id::type::dob::expiry_date::date_collision_increment

### RiskAssessment Identifier

*No real-world entity.*

### Profile Identifier

"profile"::exchange::username::username_collision_increment

### Offer Identifier

"offer"::exchange::exchange_offer_identifier::exchange_offer_identifier_collision_increment

### Trade Identifier

"trade"::exchange::exchange_trade_identifier::exchange_trade_identifier_collision_increment

### Message Identifier

"message"::exchange::exchange_trade_identifier::timestamp::timestamp_collision_increment::first_n_alphanumeric_characters

### Invoice Identifier

"invoice"::[see Trade]

### Account Identifier

* Banking networks: "account"::network::api::currency::network_identifier (e.g. sort_code::account_number)
* Blockchain networks: "account"::network::api::currency::address
* Exchange networks: "account"::exchange::api::currency::profile::deposit_address

### Account NetworkAccountName

* Banking networks: "Account name"
* Blockchain networks: "Address"
* Exchange networks: ???

### Account Label

* Banking networks: "Banking nickname / assumed account name"
* Blockchain networks: "A useful label"
* Exchange networks: ???

### Payment Identifier

Unique banking network identifiers (e.g. FPS TRN) are not available.
Blockchain network transcation identifiers may not be unique due to cloned networks and multiple currencies/tokens, therefore there is a collision risk.  
Internal exchange "profile to profile" payments may have no identifier system so may need to involve timestamps and deposit addresses.

Proposed:

* Banking networks: "payment"::network::api::currency::api_identifier (e.g. ERN)
* Blockchain networks: "payment"::network::api::currency::tx_id
* Exchange networks: "payment"::exchange::api::currency::timestamp:deposit_address

### Payment Memo

Used for communication with **Customer**s and the link **Payment**s to **Invoice**s.

* Banking networks: "Payment reference"
* Blockchain networks: "TX ID"
* Exchange networks: "Deposit address"

### Currency Code

e.g. GBP, BTC etc.

### Rate Identifier

market::base_currency_code::quote_currency_code::timestamp
